Purpose
=======

I'll be developing a final Woas here.

* First version implements what I want as an HTA file, Microsoft's Internet Explorer application runner. This allows editing and saving (even binary saves in some locales) in about every Windows ever created (as least back to IE6), including Windows 10. I will only be testing using the IE11 engine.
  *+ Fixes for earlier versions will be considered as offered.
  *+ Not done until new parser and macros are complete, modules work properly, and the IE load/save local/cloud modules are available as a working plugin (may continue to use plugin nomenclature to distinguish from generic JS modules).

* Second version takes the completed work and adds plugins for Firefox load/save, probably via extension as an example sextension for TiddlyWiki (TW) already exists. My extension will also work for TW.

* Third version will complete with an electron/nw.js/deno reader/writer/server app for non-Javascript browsers and browsers other than the above. I will not be developing a new Java load/save plugin until and unless a deep need is felt and expressed. I would prefer to use both Deno and Typescript if possible; Deno scratches most of the Node.js itches I have, though more research is needed and it is a very recet startup.

* Fourth and final version will add a few Woas2 page apps (Journal, Passwords, To-do lists, etc., throw in some new macros, and complete work on the help/tutorial plugin.

* I am working on a parallel project called SHOWER: Social Heuristics Optimizing World Environment Realizer. Shower is my priority, but much of this Woas completion work will be of use in Shower, I hope.

Cheers, Paul pvhl.
