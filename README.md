Woas
====

Woas is a complete wiki in a single HTML file that works in every major browser, including older versions (even IE6!). It can store and display wiki pages, images, and files within itself and is incredibly useful for research and documentation. It is a fork of [the SourceForge 'stickwiki' WoaS project][1].

I am doing development work here for [my version of WoaS][2], unimaginitively called *Woas*. I am using GitHub to develop, and pushing milestones to my [SF project][2] where most interaction will take place. At least that's the plan for now.
