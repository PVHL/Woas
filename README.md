Woas
====

Woas is a complete, multipage wiki in a single HTML file that works in every major browser, including older versions. It can parse marked-up text as individual wiki pages, complete with Javascript and CSS, store and display images or text/binary files within itself, run special system and user macros, and is incredibly useful for research, teaching, and documentation.

Woas development was hurt by repeated changes to browsers to stop local saving (though it continued to be able to display pages and import local WSIF files, allowing non-browser editing by the skilled radable by any browser).

The IE .hta extension hack and Firefox TiddlyWiki browser extension kept things working for some, but Woas was no longer the ubiquitous tool it once was.

Woas 2 will change all that. Current work is in the Woas2 directory.
